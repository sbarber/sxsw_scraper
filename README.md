## Synopsis

A simple ruby script to parse / scrape SXSW 2018's showcase website. Also will provide json static file updates that you can use in your scripts (ie: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbarber/sxsw_scraper/master/sxsw-showcases-20180803090846.json`)

## Motivation

wth? SXSW doesn't have a json output of their showcase data? I wrote a scraper to expose the data!

## Installation
