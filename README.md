## Synopsis

A simple ruby script to parse / scrape SXSW 2016's showcase website. Also will provide json static file updates that you can use in your scripts (ie: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbarber/sxsw_scraper/master/sxsw-showcases-20160224134325.json`)

## Motivation

wth? SXSW doesn't have a json output of their showcase data? I wrote a scraper to liberate the data!

## Installation

Use with ruby > 2.2 -  `bundle install` and go!
